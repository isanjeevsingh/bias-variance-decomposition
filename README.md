# Polynomial Curve Fitting and Bias Variance Decomposition Charts

The Python jupyter notebook tries to recreate the charts presented in the PRML book, which can be found here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/prml-book/.
You can find the polynomial curve fitting shown in the notebook on page 7 of the PRML book. The bias variance decomposition chart can be found on page 150 of the PRML book. I have also written a blog post on medium which provides in-depth detail of bias variance decomposition, you can find it here: https://medium.com/@isanjeevsingh/understanding-the-concept-with-a-detailed-practical-example-from-the-bishops-prml-book-1782c2ef6ee7.
